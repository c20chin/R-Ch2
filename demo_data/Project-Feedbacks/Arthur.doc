1. A very creative video clip with different voice tones 
2. The video clip is well-edit
3. For a person who does not watch animation, the story is a little confusing for me

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The tone changing is good. 2. I can feel the emotion in your voice. 3. Some lines can't be heard clearly.
Q: Did you and Louis know you were dubbing the same anime?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
Is this your favorite anime?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your imitation is good, and the theme of the cartoon is cool.
You can add subtitles into the clip.
I am wondering why you want to choose the episode?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

Great choice, it’s one of the most epic scenes from the show! Love how you voice acted for these characters, you did a wonderful job! Maybe you can try to find an editing app that won’t keep advertising itself next time?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Voice is so clear and pronunciation is good.
I like the background music adding.
Well done. I have a great impression on your work.

Maybe try to add subtitles.
If you are able to to that, maybe try to change your voice more according to the different characters.
There is a whole part which starts from 3:05 to 4:04 don't have any lines, only the original music and some impression by the characters, so I consider that maybe you can change this part cause I want to listen to your dubbing lines more.
Also there is two people doing the same anime, so my interest to enjoy the video would decrease a bit.

Do you like the ending of "Attach on Titan"?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

It is good to have background information in the transcript. And also the soundtracks are pretty cool. However the content in the clip is less compare to others.

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

1. The pronunciation is good!
2. He speaks with emotions.
 At 2:38, the background music suddenly become so louder which did scared me.
Overall, it's great!

feedback
1 The video clip is eye-catching
2 Some sound effect were added precisely
3 It may be better if the video got the subtitles 

things I wondered
Did you find the script more helpful than normal articles when dubbing ?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

The video clip is very good, personally like this clip very much, will attract me to continue to watch. And very few people would want to do such a difficult film clip, so I think it's really cool! I also like the way he tries to switch between the voices of different characters with different emotions. But it would have been better if he had subtitles, because I couldn't catch some of the words, and then I had to go back and forth between the film and the script. Maybe I'm lazy, so I think subtitles are better.

great dubbing and unique voices and emotions for different characters. Which comic is it? Is it ?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

The video topic is good. I love animation
the voice is clear
I hear the crack sound. Do the warm up before recording

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

Your video is quite exciting!!! And you perform well. I think you can add cc in the video, and the background voice is a little loud sometimes I can not hear your voice clearly. I am wondering why you choose the video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

First, I think you did a great job on the voice acting, especially for Reiner. Second, the sound effects are fantastic! They really bring the clip to a more professional level. However, some redubbings aren't fluent enough( like the Eren part) Maybe you can mimic how the original actor's rhythm and segments. I am really interested in this part of the anime(XD). So do you often watch the original soundtrack or the English redubbing?

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

The video is interesting to watch. You keep the original sound effect and the music, which makes it more like the original version and dramatic. I would like to watch a version where you dub for Mikasa as well! I like your acting, and I see different emotions in different characters. It would be better if you give them different voices. But overall this is nicely done!

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

Well, I also did an AOT redubbing. This scene is amazing in every aspect. I wonder why you risk to spoiler for everyone in the class though XD

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The topic is interesting.  Redubbing animation clips is fun. There is a exciting background music, which is great. However, the redubbing voice is a little bit not clear and loud enough. 
Are you a fan of Attack on Titan?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

Your choice of topic is interesting! And the audio quality is also exceptionally good! Really interested in how you completely erased the interfering noises. And great acting also? In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the vowels; try to make more distinctions between each and exaggerate them I guess? One thing I am wondering: Did you also do the dubbing for all the yelping and yelling in the video? If so, that's truly impressive!
