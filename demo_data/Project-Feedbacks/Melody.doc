2.You did a very great job on mixing all the clips together!
3. How long did it took you to make this clip?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The voice imitation is amazing, go get a job as a voice actor please. 2. Great accent. 3. In the last part your voice didn't sync with the video. Try editing it.
Q: Do you like Frozen so you use it as your dubbing material?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
You did well on this task.
Which one do you like more, Frozen 1 or Frozen 2?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Wow, I can't even tell if the voice were all dubbed by you, cause it's so similar to the original one, especially the beginning part. But I think you can work on the sound track separation more, it is a little bit blur when switching between different character's lines.
I'm wondering are you post it on YouTube also? Cause you put "please subscribe and hit the like" in the end.

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

The pronunciation is vivid, and the diversity of the variation is charming.
Some lines don't match with the timing when the characters are speaking.
 I am wondering that did you dub with the male's sound?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

I  really like Frozen! And I like the way you changed your tone for different characters. However, in some part your voice is a little low (Anna and Kristoff in the forest scene ), so it was a little difficult to hear clearly.

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Good choice for the clip, good voice acting! The video editing is a little bit weird sometimes. Maybe you can sing Do You Wanna Build a Snowman next time lol?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

1. She speaks emotionally which can attract viewers.
2. The sound is clear.
The line at 1:15 suddenly turns low which cannot be hear clearly.
And sometimes the lines doesn't match the subtitles.

positives
1 the opening and the ending of the video are well edited
2 the voice was so cute and well dubbed as if the character wad alive again
3 some sentences will be said more quickly than the character in the animation  

things I wondered
Were you the voice actor of Anna? How can your voice fit so well?!

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

I think the clips are very interesting, and then it's easy to understand the content. Interestingly, she used different voice lines to represent each character. I like the voice of Anna when she was young. However, the voice, mouth shape of characters and subtitles are not completely correct, which will make the audience confused. Editing needs to be improved, because sometimes the pictures and sounds jump to another clip.

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

the topic is very innovative, and the voice are variable due to different characters. Did you dub every characters or only one?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

First, I like your Anne redubbing. It's sound so cute, just like the original. Second, the voice is clear enough to understand. However, some voice not really sync with the original video clip. May you need to do more on the editing or try to redub more times. And I think that if you choose to redub an animation, you have to do the male actor(like Kristoff) too? After watching the video, I wonder that why did you choose to edit two short clips together rather than redub a whole clip from the movie?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

Your voice can change amazingly! And I think you perform well. I think your voice sometimes pretty match the character's mouth but it's not big issue. I wonder that why you choose the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

it is so awesome that I can hear two type of the voice in different role. so genius.
the pronunciation is great
the volume can be a little biit louder.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

I like it that you make different voices for the characters! It is so pleasant to watch and your Anna is so cute! I think it is difficult to add(or keep) music in a movie clip, for you needed to take off voices of characters. But you still managed to do it, so it is impressive! There must be lots of works to do. Good job! For suggestions, since the character has very vivid mouth movement when they talk, it would be better if your voice sync with their lips. How much time do you spend on this video? I can see lots of efforts you put into it and I think you've done a great job!

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

Disney animations are the best, and your redubbing is so cute that matches all the characters. I wonder why you chose these clips to dub though.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The redubbing is clear and loud. There are subtitles to help people understand the video. You talk vividly and try to use different voices. There are some sound effects, too.

The video is extremely interesting! I can see that you really put a lot of efforts into the making of the video by compiling all the different clips of "Frozen"! I also liked it that you changed your voice for each character - it really makes the video more understandable:) (And nice acting by the way!) However sometimes when a sentence is said more quickly, you tend to slur your speech a bit (but it 's a really minor issue), maybe you can practice speaking faster in daily life? Overall it's really nice! One thing I am wondering: Are you a big fan of Frozen?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>
