1. A well-edit clip with a clear voice
2. Some of the words in the clip were hard to make out but most of them were great
3. Does Michael Jordan has the longest hang time up until today?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The sound quality is great. 2. Your voice sound vigorous. 3. You can edit those part when you stuttered.
Q: Why choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
Is he your favorite basketball player?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear, and the theme of the video is interesting :)
Pronunciations can be improved effectively with more practices.
I am wondering why you didn't put any BGM?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

The voice is pretty clear. I can understand most of the contents without seeing subtitles. However, if you could put some background music or soundtracks it would make the video more interesting.

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

I like the video choice, it's interesting.
Good dubbing and tone

Maybe practice more when you say the number(for instance1.038)
The voice quality need to be improved.
maybe add some subtitles.

I assume you like basketball, so what position do you play in a game?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Good video choice, and great narrating tone. But I think you made some mistakes but didn’t edit it out or redo it, and you don’t have any sound effects of background music. Who’s your favorite basketball player?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

1. The voice is loud and clear.
2. He speaks emotionally.
 However, there is something in the background which blocks the audience for watching.

I know more about basketball.

feedback
1 the voice is nice and fluent
2 the voice sync the video perfectly
3 It would be better to have some background music and subtitles

things I wondered
Is Michael Jordan your idol?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

I can see you really like basketball, just my opinion. Maybe you can try to dub the NBA game? You can be the anchor for the game, I think it would be more entertaining than a TED ED.
Which team do you support the most in the NBA?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

First, I think the voice is clear and easy to understand. Second, the video choice is good. The length and the topic of the video are both nice. However, some of the voice not quite sync with the original video clip and I think the redub could be done better. You can try redubbing more times to be more fluent. As for my question, did you choose this video because you like basketball? If not, then why?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

Your voice is quite clear and the video is interesting and it's not hard to know that you're a basketball lover. Maybe you can try to add cc in your video. I am wondering that which planets you can play basketball the best on?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the halt in the video is kinda odd, try to break the sentence appropriately
the volume is loud enough
the pronunciation is clear

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Your audio quality is very good. I can hear you clearly. And the pace is pretty nice, too. I can follow you easily. For advice, maybe you can lower the tone(pitch) for some part, so it may create a flow of intonation. For some parts (like 01:46) it seems like you stumbled on words, maybe redo that little part would help improve the fluency! This clips connected MJ and science fact, and it is interesting to watch. Thank you!

It's very clear what Jeffrey is talking about without too much noise. And then if there's background music, it's better, and if make a mistake, I think it's better to re-record it, otherwise there will be a noticeable stall. I wonder what the world would be like without gravity, what if we grew up in a world without gravity, I really wondering it.

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

The video makes the formulas easier to understand. It also fits our science knowledge level.
I wonder why you pause so many times in the narrating but choose not to edit them out.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud. The topic is interesting. However, it would be more understandable if you add subtitles. 
Is Jordan your favorite basketball player?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The topic is quite interesting since it uses "Michael Jordan" to illustrate a very difficult physics problem! Your voice is also presented really clearly and there is no noise in the background! However it is a pity that there is no background music or I think the video will be more interesting. And there is a watermark right in the center of the visual which can sometimes be distracting (but I know it perhaps cannot be helped due to technical problems TT)  I also think you can work more on the vowels in terms of pronunciation! Perhaps exaggerate them and make more distinctions between each? One thing I am wondering: Will you think about the theory next time you play basketball haha?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

1.you may chance the product so that the mark may be erased
2.your voice is  quite clear, and you can connect the words more smoothly will be better
Does our height decide how height can we jump?
