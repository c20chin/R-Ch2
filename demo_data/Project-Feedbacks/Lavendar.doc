3. It would be great to add some creativity to the clip.

1. The voice quality is good. 2. Your pronunciation is clear. 3. The transcript looks a little tight. Perhaps you can loosen up the line spacing.
Q: Is there a a reason why you choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

The pronunciation is really good and I like the background music. However, I heard some buzz sounds (I am not sure if it was a part of background music) it would be better if you erased that sound.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is fluent.
Your clip is well designed.
How has the clock changed your life?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

nice tone and good pronunciation
The video is quite cute.

I consider that you didn't remove the original soundtrack because I can hear the original speaker's voice in the background. and that really reduce the quality of your work though your dubbing is great.

Did Banneker die naturally at the age of 75?
Do you also think his house was burned in an accident?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

A very informative video, and you’re very fluent and spoke well. I think overall you did awesome, good job!

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Great pronunciation. And I can see that you put intonation into it. 
I wonder do you know Benjamin Banneker before? Or you know him after you record this video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

great voice and some details like words be pronounced together instead of individual ones are well-done. But I think the speed can be a little bit slower since we just doing video dubbing not talking to foreigners.

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

1.The pronunciation is good.
2.The sound is clear.

Overall, I think it's very great. At present, I couldn't think of what can be improved!

positives
1 the pronunciation is clear and the talk is fluent
2 the background music fits the video perfectly
3 sometimes there will be some tinny sounds

things I wondered
Is Banneker's story special to you? Why do you want to choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

I love your redub. The added sound effects and the pronunciation are both excellent. The content of the video is very interesting as well. For one thing I wonder is that is those sound effects original form the video or you added on your own? If you added on your own, where did I you get all these sound effects? They are amazing!

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

the mic noise in the video, try to use better earphone to record
the pronunciation is good
the tune is great.

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

your voice is really clear and you speak fluently, and you add cc to make me understand the content easily. I am wondering that why you choose the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

1. Thank you for providing subtitles. This help me understand the video much easier and I think it is very thoughtful of you!
2. I love the pace you talk. How you control your speed and the way you pause creates the "flow," which make you sounds more like a native speaker.
3. I don't see big issue to bring up. Maybe the transcripts can be divided into several paragraph so it would be easier to read. 
4. Is the music in the video from the original clip or did you find another music source? I think it suits your content so well!

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

Pronunciation is very clear! The sound quality is also very good, the whole film is very smooth. The pronunciation is clear! The sound quality is also good, the whole film is very smooth. And then I wondered, why burn the banneker's home? Is there anything necessary to exist? This is just my curiosity to know.

The video surly summerized the life of a great genius who is far-sighted in so many aspects.
I wonder why this person is so indicated in moving forward

The redubbing voice is fluent and clear, and the subtitles help people understand the video.  However, you can hear the original voice of the video slightly. 
Is he one of your favorite figures?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

Your intonation makes the content of the video certainly more interesting and digestible (it has relatively greater fluctuations)! And the speech flow is comfortable to the ears:) Overall it is great and I found no real faults. One thing I am wondering: why did you choose the topic focusing on Benjamin Banneker?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

your voice and pace are both clear, and you chose a decent background.
maybe you can stress some words to highlight important words. Because your sound is tender and soft~
Were there anything else that thrived the development of agriculture at that time?
