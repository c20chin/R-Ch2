1. A well-edit clip 
2. A very great pace and our voice is very clear
3. I’m wondering how the boy you talked about at the start of the clip, survive not sleeping for 11 days

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The vigor in your voice makes the video dynamic. 2. The quality of the recording is good. 3. Some words are not pronounced correctly. You can look them up if you're not sure how they should sound like.
Q: After watching this video, will you keep an eye on your sleep more?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your story is informative.
Your subtitles is well designed.
It will be better if the advertisement is removed.
Do you think sleep helps your mental health?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

It is an informative video and the voice is really clear. If you can add background music it would make the video more interesting. Also, I think in 2:25 of the video, the word "Fatal" was mispronounced.

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

The theme of the video is cool, and your voice is clear.
You can look up the pronunciations of some words before recording.

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

1.because the paintings in the beginning parts are great, it will be better if you can erase the mark 2.at the end of the video, the voice starts to low down a little bit, you can maintain the same volume as the beginning~ and your intonation is decent to the video~

the video mentioned that without sleep may cause some serious issues, but if you do sleep but not sleep well, is that will cause the same issues as well?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Clear voice, good recording quality.
Tone is on point.

The topic choice seems less creative compared with others.
Some pronunciation of word can be improved.
Voice sometimes become louder and lower abruptly.

Do you think you get enough sleep every day?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Cool video! And very informative as well. Good narrating voice. Maybe you can work on the connecting of different words, though. What was the longest time you ever stay awake?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

good subtitle and voice. Some words do not pronounce the same as we usually hear, but it's quite terrific in total.

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

Interesting topic, students often sleep less. You can still work on the pronunciation more! Still have some accent in your English, but I think you can erase it as the time goes.
Have you also lose sleep sometimes? How do you cope with it?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

1.The sound is clear and loud enough.
2. She speaks emotionally.
Is there something in the background? It could be better if it can be removed.

I am just wondering how can Randy Gardner stayed awake for 264 hours, it's terrific.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

positives
1 the subtitles appeared right on time
2 the background music fits the video 
3 some pronunciations needed to be check(such as "ability")

things I wondered
After dubbing the video, will you try to go to bed early?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

First, the voice quality and clarity are good. Second, the video choice is excellent. The length and the topic are both good. However, some of the words was not well-pronounced enough like "focusing" and "devoted". Finally, I want to ask why you choose this video and do you get enough sleep (7-8 hrs) after watching the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

your video is just like the professional video! your voice is great! but sometimes i can't listen some words clearly. i am wondering that why you want to choose this video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

the speed is appropriate
the british acent is strong 
the volume is good

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

I think your video is in high quality! Your voice is very clear and I can hear your pronunciation perfectly. I like your speaking tone. It sounds patiently and not rush, so I can follow you well. As for advise, maybe you can balance the volume of your vocal and the background music. But this is still nicely done and also informative. I wonder if you spend a lot of time practicing the pronunciation of some of the vocabulary, because I see there are lots of them that are so hard to pronounce, but you did it well!

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The video surely give us a waring about how important sleeping is to not only our body, but our minds. I still wonder the suggested time of napping though.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud, and there are subtitles to help understand. However, some words can be pronounced more clearly to help understand. 
Have you ever stayed awake for for more than 24 hours?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The topic is really interesting and educational! It really makes me realize the importance of sleeping. The overall video quality is well done - though I think you can raise the volume of the background music. In terms of pronunciation, I think you can distinguish between the vowels more, because the difference now doesn't seem very clear (or maybe it's because that you have a more british-ish accent?) One thing I am wondering: I've also heard that the time one needs to sleep depends on their genes - I've always been curious about which theory I should believe in; the gene theory or the one you presented in the video? (because sadly I sleep for relatively short hours:(
