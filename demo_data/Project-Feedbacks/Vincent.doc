2. It would great to add subtitles!
3. Is this a Japanese tale?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The bgm really draw our attention to the video. 2. The content of the video is interesting. 3. Some of your intonations and pronunciations are not good. Try working more on them.
Q: Are you into Japanese folk tales?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Different from other Ted talk topics, this is a story. Also the background music matched to the plots. It would be better if you put subtitles so it would make us more easy to understand.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if your voice can be louder.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

The plots of the clip is really interesting, and the background music is vivid.
You can add more circumflex into different sentences.
I am wondering that why you chose this episode?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

I like the story. Good video choice.
Background music is nice.

It would be better if you add subtitles.
Your voice is not quite clear as your background music is too loud and some pronunciation could be improved. 
and also the sound of your breath( mic)

How can a tanuki know how to tell tales and do trick?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

1.the music is great but is a little bit interrupt your voice 2. add some subtitle may be better
Do you believe tanuki really exists in the world and to play tricks or protect the visitors?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Cool choice, good quality visually. But you can try to speak clearer. What’s the reason for choosing this?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

The video is interesting. It is an inspiring story, and the animation is very cute. But I think you still have heavy accent in your English, work on that more！
I wonder why you choose this clip instead of a speech? Do you prefer story more?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

the story is interesting and the background music is pleasant XDDD. I think it would be better if the subtitles are added because the voice is husky that some words are a little bit hard to recognize. Is the story truly happened or it was a fairy story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

1.The background music is good.
2. The sound is clear.
However, the background music is so loud which has covered your voice. Moreover, could be work harder on the pronunciation.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

positives
1 the video is appealing and interesting
2 the background music fits the video perfectly
3 maybe some subtitles could be added

things I wondered
Do you like Asian style carton better or American style?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

The topic is interesting and the background music is good. However, the background music is also a problem because it a little bit to loud and I can't hear your pronunciation clear enough. As for my question, did you know what a tanuki is before you watched the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

the music is great, i love the japanese style
the pause in the video sounds a little bit werid
the pronunciation is clear

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

I think you have done well! and the story is touched and funny. but your voice is not really clear (I think you may have a  sore throat ) And I want to ask that if you are the old man, when you hear yell in the forest, will you take a look?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

I think it's an interesting video clip, and then the video clip is very smooth, and there's no problem with suddenly cutting off. It's just that I think the sound quality might need to be a little bit better, only at the end is the sound quality better. I wonder why this sudden respect for the tanuki? I've watched it many times and I still don't understand.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The music is so impressive. It somehow makes this video touching and it catches all my attention, making me want to listen to the story carefully.  I like the way you tell the story, too, like you are telling it with a calm tone and making audience want to know every details. Though I think the volume of the music can be lower, for it sometimes covered your voice. Despite that, this video is so well-done. If you run a YouTube channel where you tell stories, I would love to subscribe! I was thinking where I can get more videos like this after I watched it!

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The story is fun and interesting. The animation portrays well. I wonder if your microphone is broken or not, because I find your voice hoarse.

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The topic is great! The story is extremely interesting and I am actually really enthralled with it! The Japanese background music is also immersing - it really helps the viewers get into the story. In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the vowels (exaggerate the pronunciation of them, and make the difference between each clearer?) It's also very interesting that I find that you kind of have a tone pattern in your speech that goes downwards before going upwards - maybe you can work on different kinds of patterns more? One thing I am wondering: it says in the video that shape-changing tanukis pull their testicles to transform, that sounds kind of painful, isn't it? Or did I misunderstand haha?
