1. A well-edit clip with a very clear voice
2. It would be great to add some creativity to the clip such as using different tones to speak
3. So how can we stop feel anxious about math? Because I think I have math anxiety, too

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. Precise pronunciation. 2. Clear audio.
Q: Do you have academic anxiety as well?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

the voice and pace are excellent! And your vowel sounds are clarified, one minor issue, not to rise your intonation immediately but to gradually rise it~
 I'm wondering that who is the person easily get math anxiety?girl?or?(like characteristics)

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It is good that you had subtitles in your video clip.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

Your circumflex is well-done, and your voice is pretty clear.
You can practice more on your pronunciations.
I am wondering whether you have the same problem?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Good tone adding to your voice.
Smooth work in general.

The background music is little bit too loud sometimes might cover your voice.
Video choice can be more creative.

Do you also think you are not smart enough to solve math problem as the French mathematician in high school?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Very informative video, great tone and sounds very fluent! Nothing much to be fixed, it’s good. We’re you good at math back in high school?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Now I know why my math is so poor now :( , Great pronunciation and pace ! But I think topic is a little bit boring, I hope you can dub something having more intonation in it.
Do you like math? Or you are also poor at math just like me?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

1. The pronunciation is good.
2. The voice is loud and clear.

However, from my point of view, I prefer the background music could be adjust a bit lower in order for the viewers to focus more on the voice.

good subtitles and clear voice. Do all the ways the video mention help or some of them does not make sense as well?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

the pronunciation is wonderful
the tone is great

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

Your voice is really clear and the video is worth knowing. You did well! I wonder that why you choose the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

First, your voice clarity is good. The voice fluency and the pronunciation are both excellent.  Second, I love the background music you added to your video. I think it makes the clip more energetic and entertaining.  However, it would be better if  you turn down the sound a little bit. I've been always bad at math, so I want to ask how about you? Are  you good or bad at math? Do you have math anxiety like it said in the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Your video gives me a delightful feeling, maybe it is because of the music or your nice voice! The intonation is great and  you sounds energetic. You sounds very fluent in speaking and this makes your video easy to understand!  After I watched your video, I started to wonder the possibility of me being good at math! It is inspiring!

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

Good sound quality! Then the film is also very smooth, in the pronunciation is also very clear, do not need to read subtitles can also be heard very clearly. I don't have wonder something about it. But I had the idea that I didn't have math anxiety and I still hated math.

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

So that's the reason why I get so panicked every time during math exams though I do well in all practice runs. I really get to know this better through this video. I wonder how I can conquer this faster.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The redubbing voice is fluent and clear. There are background music and subtitles in the video, which is great. 
Do you have math anxiety?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

I think the topic is very interesting! Your intonation makes the video really interesting, and the background music makes for the lightheartedness of the video. In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the vowels (like make the distinction between each clearer and exaggerate them?) One thing I am wondering: Do you wish that you knew the psychological mechanism when you were learning math?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

Good pronunciation and the voice in the clip is really clear. I also think it is a really interesting topic, I learned a lot from it.
