1. It would be great if you add subtitles 
2. It is good that you change tone with different characters 
3. The clip is a bit confusing to me because it seems like a part of a animation

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The recording is very clear. 2. It's nice to hear that you imitated the characters' tone. 3. Some of the pronunciations are not clear.
Q: Why choose a Japanese anime?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

The video is really different from others and you used different tones to express. It would be better if you put subtitle so the audience could easily understand.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your video is well designed.
The redubbing voice sometimes doesn't sync with the video clip.
Is this your favorite clip in this anime?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

Your voice is vivid, and the plots are interesting.
Some lines  cannot match with the timing when the characters start to speak.
I'm wondering that what cartoon it is.

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

1.you are really good at acting with your sounds~great 2 .some of the words can be more clarified, and the intonation somehow will not fit in the sentence(a few)

what is the name of this movie? and how can you did so well to present all emotion of characters?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

I like you choose to dub an anime.
Good tone changing fit to the different character.

I think you should try to change your voice (if you are capable of)to distinguish different characters since there are a lot of characters. Sometimes I am not sure who is talking.
And maybe add some subtitles to help the viewer better understand it.
Video quality can be improved. And maybe some background music?

Why does the protagonist always look so mad?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Interesting choice for the video clip; the tone is good, but you can make more variations between different characters for the listeners to better distinguish who’s actually talking.
Why do you choose this scene? Isn’t there lots of more famous scene from AOT?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

good intonation that makes the video vivid, and the materials are great. Is the script the same as the plot or it was rewritten?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

Aot is a hard one for dubbing, glad you have the courage to try. But I think you type wrong name in your transcript, it should be John instead of Jean. And also your length isn't enough, it should be at least three minutes.
Do you also watch the Aot? Which character do you like the most?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

1.The voice is clear.
2.Speaks with emotion.

It could be better to add the subtitle. Also, since there are more than one characters in the video and you are the only voice, so there is a bit confusing.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

positives
1 the dubbing for laughter is fits the character's emotion
2 the video clip is quite interesting
3 It would be better to have some subtitles

things I wondered
What is the name of the animation? Is it your favorite one?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

The video is entertaining and quality is good. However, I think the pronunciation can be improve and if you choose a anime video, you have to do some voice acting, that would make your video better and more clear. As for my question, I would like to know why you chose this video and do you often watch the English version of the anime?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Full of emotions XD, and you speak clearly. maybe you can add cc in your video. I am wondering why Sasha looks so surprised in the end.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

it will be better if you try to change the voice and intonation between every character
the volume is good enough
the video is good, at least I can feel relaxed after watching TED-ED clips

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

I think the film clip itself is very difficult, there may be some intonation, mood and character identification problems, I think the sound quality and film quality are good. And then I wondered why the background music was missing.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

It is so cool to see this anime being redubbed! I like the emotion you put into your acting. And your pronunciation is clear, too, so I can understand the scripts without subtitles. It would be more interesting to watch if you make different voices for the characters since you have good energy when you act. And maybe adding some music would create the atmosphere easily. I wonder if you layered your voice( recording the dubbing several times) or if you did the dubbing in maybe one or two times. I think to express different characters through acting is really hard, but you did a good job!

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The topic of your video is interesting. Redubbing animation clips is fun. It is good that you talk vividly since it is like a drama. However, the video is quite confusing  without subtitles when different characters talk. 
Are you a fan of Attack on Titan?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The video is extremely creative since you chose to do a dubbing for an animation! You also put a lot of emotions in each line which makes the video extra interesting (good acting)! However there are a total of eight (if I am not mistaken) characters in your video, but they're all presented under your voice which can be sometimes really confusing for the listeners, especially when a character continues speaking when the visual shifts to another character. One thing I'm wondering: is the clip from one of your favorite animations?
