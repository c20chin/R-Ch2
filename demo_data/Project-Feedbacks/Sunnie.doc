Q: Why choose a horror story to dub?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Jeez, it's really a horror animation isn't it? I like your creativity, and the granny's smile is....terrifying. But I think you can work on your pronunciation more, I think you're trying to use the US tone but it turned out to be a tone mixing with both US and UK :(

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

This story is interesting.
Your clip is well designed.
What does that old woman want to do?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

The voice is clear, and the plots are exciting.
The scary part of the clip really frightens me..
I am wondering whether you feel scared when dubbing?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Cool story, and I love the way you varies your tone while narrating the story. I still wonder what the old woman wanted?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

The video choice is creative.
Thanks for the subtitles and good adding some background music.


The background music is a bit too loud at 1:52.
Pronunciation can be improved( for instance: a minute later, again, it's another tip, ignored)
Add more tone to your voice to create a creepy atmosphere is suggested.

Do you like horror story or movie?

The background music really makes the video more creepy but this video really surprise me (in a good way). The video is a little short compare to others, but I think the content is sufficient.

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

positives
1 the video clip is quite special and professional looking
2 the background music fits the video perfectly
3 make sure the filename is correct

things I wondered
Won't you be a little afraid when dubbing the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

This clip of the film is so interesting that makes me want to continue watching it. Then the subtitles made me understand what she was talking about, which was very helpful. But I think maybe the intonation has to be more up and down, so you can feel more like you're telling a story and also have more emotion when you are talking.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

very scary and impressed. good subtitles. ''decided'' the 'id' sound at the end didn't pronounce very clear.

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the tone can be more dynamic.
the video topic is good.
the volume is loud enough.

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

It's a interesting but scary video. It is scary to see this in the midnight. I think you speak well.  I am wondering why you choose the horrible video.

(Are you Sunnie Chau? I couldn't tell by the file name, but this feedback is for you;))
The atmosphere is so great and I was scared by the creepy setting! The music you added in the video worked so well that I don't have the courage to watch the full clip(but I did!). Though I was nervous, I still enjoyed it. As for advise, some of the words seem not to be pronounced fully(like "-ed" in past-tense verbs were not pronounced). But it is still a very good video to watch. I wonder if you enjoy horror movie? This clip is unique and nicely chosen!

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

First, the sound effects are amazing. It really gives me a chill. Second, I think you've done a great job in the segments and your voice is loud and clear. However, some words aren't quite well-pronounced like"across" and "exact". Last, I'm wondering why did you choose a ghost story? It's bad for my heart. ;-;

The redubbing voice is clear and loud. There are some sound effects and background music, which makes it more interesting. However, it is a little bit too short.

The story is really good! It totally freaked me out with all the background music and sound effects! Really nice job! The audio quality is also exceptionally good - I don't think I've heard any interfering noises! In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the vowels - like try to make more distinctions between each I guess? One thing I am wondering: So who is the old woman? Why does she act so creepily?
