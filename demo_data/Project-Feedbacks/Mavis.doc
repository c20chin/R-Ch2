1. A very informative video with a very clear voice
2. Some of the  ore difficult words were kind of hard to make out but it is great overall
3. So  did ballet used to be a performance only allowed for royals?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. You have talked in a nice speed. 2. The accent is good. 3. You might want to increase the range of your tone because your voice sounded flat in the video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is fluent.
Your clip is well designed.
The sound effects are good.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your pronunciation is pretty good, and your voice sounds so professional!
You can add more circumflex when saying different sentences!
I am wondering that did you take this video without any fragmental distribution?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

I like the background music because it match with the theme, also I have learned something in this video. If your tone fluctuates more, it would be better.

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Good dubbing, the voice is clear and fit in the video perfectly.
Thanks for the subtitles.

Maybe you can record your lines separately because sometimes you feel like out of breath and I can hear you inhaling deeply.
The video kind of ended abruptly.
The background music sounds like echo(）

Do you know how to dance ballet?

Your voice is very clear and your pronunciation is very good! Btw it’s a good video choice! Maybe you can edit the transcript a little bit so that it can be more audience friendly. Do you like ballet?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

1.The voice is clear.
2. The content is interesting.
For me, the background music is very rich which obscure your voice a bit.

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

subtitles are added which is very good, and the voice is quite clear, but some words do not pronounce very clear.

1 the voice is really fluent 
2 the background music was chosen nicely
3 it would be better to edit a proper end for the video

things I wondered
Do you think "love dancing ballet" fit the image of Louis XIV in your heart?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

Before I watch your video, I never know that the title " sun king " is origin from his childhood experience in ballet. The video is entertaining, no big issue in your homework.
Do you like history? which part do you like the most in the history timeline ?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

First, the voice is clear and easy to understand. Second, I think the video choice is very good. The topic is interesting and the length is perfect. However, you you can add some rhythm to your voice or strength some key words, it would be better. One thing I wonder is that did you choose this video because you dance ballet or have some other reasons that made you choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

your voice is clear enough and the video is interesting and worth knowing. I am curious why you choose the topic?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

the video is  informative
the volume is loud enough
the tone is good

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

I love how your music entered the video. It creates a dramatic vibe. And you spoke in a calm way and the pace is comfortable to listen to! Maybe raising the voice could create a more obvious contrast in the intonation so it would sound even more dramatic. This is such an interesting topic to watch. Do you dance ballet?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

Overall good, sound quality and film are very good, don't know what to say. And then I have a problem, I don't know if it's my problem, I can't hear it very well when Melody is talking. I wonder why anyone would want to go to ballet in the old days when the rules were so strict, because it was really hard work.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

Never interested in ballet before, but this video caught my eyes. The subtitles are great too. I wonder what I can learn constructively in this history video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud. There is a background music in the video, which is great. The subtitles help people understand the video.  
Have you ever learned ballet before?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

the story is historical and interesting, thank you for sharing~ and you can raise and low your pitch more to highlight the important words.
Did Louis 14 also create another thing that spur the development of amusement at that era?
