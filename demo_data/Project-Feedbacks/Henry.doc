1. A very funny clip because you use different tones, it is an amazing clip 
2. It would be great to add subtitles and speak a little bit clearer
3. How long did it took to make this clip?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The voice imitation is nice. 2. We can hear your voice clearly. 3. Your pronunciation is not that clear. Maybe drop the speed a little?
Q: Why did you choose this clip?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
Is this your favorite cartoon?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your imitation is pretty funny, and it's so interesting that i have repeatedly watched for about five times hahahahaha
The pronunciations of some words can be improved with more practices!
I am wondering whether you are also a fan of Spongebob?

Good voice changing according to the characters and creative in dubbing spongebob. I like your work.
Well done !
and the background music is on point.

Maybe add some subtitles will help a lot.
 I am not sure whether you are too close to your mic when you are recording your lines because it has a sound ()
sometimes the lines are not accurately fit on the character's mouthing.

what's the difference between a hamburger and Krabby Patty?

The voice in the video is good enough. And also you have changed the tones. It would be better if you put background music.

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Excellent choice for the clip, and you did so well on voice acting! It’s great! The only thing you can fix is sometimes the background sound faded away or appeared suddenly. But it’s still a great work! Who’s your favorite character in SpongeBob?

1. It's great that he speaks with different tonation and emotions when he did the dubbing on different characteristics.
2. The sound is clear.

The pronunciation could be work a bit harder.

1 the video clip is funny and attracting
2 the voice of the video is quite clear
3 it would be better to add some subtitles, and the video length should be in 5 minutes

things I wondered
Have you ever been in Squidward's situation?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

As your roommate, I know how much efforts you put into this video. Novel idea, and your sound really match to squidward. But since it is a pronunciation homework, I believe that you should choose a clip that the characters don't have heavy accent.
Which character do you like the most?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

SPONGEBOBBBBB. very funny video even though there's no subtitles.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

the video is funny and interesting, and you perform well! I think you can add cc in your video. I am wondering why you choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

First, I love your redubbing. It sounds energetic and funny, just like the original. Second, the video quality and the voice clarity are both good. However, some words don't quite sync with the original clip. Maybe you can try redubbing more times. Last, I wonder if you love SpongeBob? Do you often watch the original soundtrack or the Chinese redubbing?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

This is so funny! Your voice fit the characters well, and you gave them life. I like it that you sounded energetic but still managed to pronounce each words. As for advice, I think you made different voices for different characters at the beginning, but as time went by the distinguish becomes unclear. It would be better if you keep the different voice for them and edit the volume to make it balance. Last but not least, the transcripts you provide is very clear, thank you!

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

It evokes my childhood, it's fun, it's smooth, and then there's an effort to make the characters sound different, it's great! I like how Henry says "And then you blow up." I am not sure why I like it, hahahaha. I wonder what kind of meat is in the middle of a Krabby Patty? Because livestock are used in the ocean?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

The video is really funny. Your dubbing is dramatic and fits characters a lot. I wonder why you can't edit the video in 3 mins.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud. There are sound effects, which makes it more interesting. However, it would be wonderful if you add subtitles.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The video is really interesting and funny (especially the dubbing for Squidward)! I can see that you've put a lot of effort into the video! Great acting! However I think you tend to slur through your speech when you try to speak faster, perhaps practicing speaking faster in daily life will help? Also I think you can work more on the vowels, try to make more distinctions between each? And I also think you can indicate which character is speaking each line in your transcript so it's more understandable for the viewers:) Overall, it's really great! One thing I am wondering: it's cool that they have a patty vault in the restaurant! But wouldn't all those patties rot?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

your sound is really like Spongebob~and as the creator, you manipulate the pitch and tone well~if you can erase some issues of over-connected the words which let your speech not so clear will be better 
Where can I find the burger in the reality, lol, because it is so  attracting for me that I would like to try it one day.
