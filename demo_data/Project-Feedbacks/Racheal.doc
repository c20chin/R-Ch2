1. A well-edit video clip with a clear voice
2. It would be great to add some creativity and tones to the video
3. A very interesting video

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The voice quality is good, we can hear you clearly. 2. The content of the video is interesting. 3. Sometimes I feel like the dubbing isn't syncing with the rhythm of the video. Maybe speed up a bit will help.
Q: Why do you choose this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

I think the video is interesting and your voice is really clear. If your tone is more fluctuate, the content would be better.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

The content of the video is interesting, and characters of the clop are cute.
You should use adequate intonations when saying different sentences and notice the noises of the voice that you frequently made in the video.

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

1, the words are clarified but the connection of the words changing into a  sentence can put more efforts on it. 2, there seems to have noises within the video, it will be better if you can erase them~
the question, for me, is really burning-nerves, can you answer it directly when your first saw it?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

The video choice was quite interesting.
Good video quality.
I am not sure whether it is the mic or your recording problem that I can hear the little noise.
Besides, I think you can add some tone in your voice cause it sounds a little too plain. 
The subtitles are not following with your lines perfectly all the time.

Why do the nine people has to listen to the aliens as they seems taller and bigger than the aliens that can easily defeat the aliens?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Interesting video, good video quality!  But maybe you can have more variations in your tone, and some part of your voice not properly edited. Did you figure out the question?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

topic is very interesting, and subtitle are attached. But the subtitle do not match the timing with the voice. Also, you can add some intonation so it would be more attracting. I wonder that are the aliens idiots?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

Interesting clip, and I can see that you are trying hard to have better pronunciation. But try not to dub one sentence at a time, controlling the timing to speak and having the ability to keep saying something are also important.
Why do you choose Ted instead of cartoon or animation?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

1.The voice is clear.
2.Overall, it is fluent.
However, not all the subtitles match with the sound correctly.

Is there really aliens in the world?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

positives
1 the subtitles were right on time
2 the voice is quite clear and fluent
3 maybe some ups and downs can make the video more vivid

things I wondered
Do you believe in alien?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

First, the voice is clear. Every word is well-pronounced and the details has been carefully taken care of. Second, the video choice is good . However, if you can add some rhythm in your voice, it will be more nature. I've seen this video before and I found it really interesting. Do you find it interesting as well?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the topic of video is quite fun. the pronunciation is clear enough to understand the meaning. she can work on the intonation for it might be a little bit boring to me while listening to it.

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

This video is interesting and  inspiring, and your voice is clear enough. But the cc runs too fast to read. i am wondering that if you're the person caught by aliens like those in video. what ways you will choose when you meet the ''hat question'' ?

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

The logic puzzle is really interesting. There are some cute sound effects in the video,which is great. However, the voice in the video doesn't match the subtitles perfectly. 
After watching the video, can you solve questions like this on your own next time?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

The sound effect is impressive. It helps me get involved to the atmosphere right away! I like it when you raised your pitch when you asked questions. It caught my attention easily! I think you could be more confident because you did a good job :) It might be better if you created the flow in the intonation(eg: switching the pace, raising the tone, etc. ), but overall this is very interesting to watch. I wonder if you solve the riddle before finishing this video? Because I never understood it haha!

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The sound quality is very good, and then this content is very interesting, very special choice, will attract me to watch, I don't know why this video clip is suitable for Rachel. But it might have to be enhanced in the editing, because there will be a little bit of obvious editing, but overall it's great. And the sound won't match the subtitles. I wonder what the purpose of the aliens is? Currently there is speculation that they are of higher civilization but are interested in races with lower civilization than their own, which I find very interesting.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

I am surprised that this quzzle can be solved in this wayï¼Œand the example is interesting. But I still wonder how people can think of this strategy in just 5 minutes.

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The content of the video is very interesting! Nice choice of topic! The dubbing is recorded greatly and I can hear you very clearly. However there seems to be some noise at the beginning of the video - not sure if it's the effect of the original video? In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the connections between individual words and the intonation (it can be more fluctuated)? One thing I am wondering: so what kind of food do the aliens rely on on their planet haha?
