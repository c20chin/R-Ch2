1. Very clear voice and the video clip is well-edit
2. The pace is great because I can hear every single word and it would be great if there was a bit more creativity in this clip
3. How did you follow the exact pace of the original video clip?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. You are so good at narrating! 2. The pronunciation is great. 
Q: Did you dub this video because you like the story or author?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

The voice is clear, and great pronunciation. Although the clip gives a chill atmosphere, it is a little bit boring. Maybe you can try to find more interesting topic(like something with more ups and downs in the tone)

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

Your voice perfectly match the theme of the video, and the circumflex is pretty good!!
You can try to do more exercises on the pronunciation;)
I am wondering how much time did you spend to find this video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Good pronunciation and smooth lines. Well done.
Like the background music and video choice. It's worthy to take some time to think about it.

Try to improve your recording quality because of the echo() , maybe you are too close to your mic?
The background music lower abruptly at 3:46. I can hardly hear it after that.

What is your personal thought about" The deeper you go, the more you find."?

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

The voice and the pronunciation is really clear. And also the background music has changed  form scene to scene.

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

1. The sound is clear.
2. The content is amusing.

It could be better to raise up the voice a bit.

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

positives
1 The theme was interesting
2 The background music is nice
3 more ups and downs can make the video more appealing

things I wondered
Is "Kafka on the shore" your favorite book?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

The video clip was clear and sound was clear, easy to understand what he was saying. Then the subtitles also helped me watch the film more easily. And then I wasn't sure if it was noise or something, and there was a rustling in the background, and I was wondering if it was noise or background music, because that would distract me from watching the movie.

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

very fluent and good subtitles. No big issues at all.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

the voice is magnetic
the pronunciation is perfect
the music is good

(Are you Patrick? Sorry I'm not sure but if you are, this is for you XD) I like the tone you use in this video. It sounds mystery and the vibe is really attractive. Your pronunciation is very clear and it is very pleasant to hear you speak. The music volume is great, too. It feels like you are the original creator of this video! Have you ever read "Kafka on the shore"? Your voice sounds so confident and stable that I wonder if you are familiar with the book!

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Your video is just like the professional one! you speak well and your voice is clear enough. I am wondering that why you choose the topic.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

First, I think you've done an excellent job in the sound effects. It really bring the video to a more professional level. Second,  your voice is loud and clear to hear, but if you can do more changes in the speed or volume, I think it will make you sound more like standard American accent. I've never heard or read about this author before. Have you read the work of his that it mentioned in the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

The redubbing voice is fluent and clear. There are a background music and subtitles, which is great. 
Do you like the book?

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

I wonder where your chinese name is.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

Interesting topic! I think you also articulates each word pretty well, and you voice is super soothing haha! Overall I think it's awesome! One thing I am wondering: Have you ever read the book? If so, what do you think about the descriptions in the video:?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

the background is excellent and so is the  pace.
If you can add some intonation in your speech will be better.
How does the term affect you?Does it change your view as evaluating things or events?
