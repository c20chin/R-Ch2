1. It is amazing how you use some many different tone in this clip
2. The clip is well-edit as there was no noise in the background
3. The video is a little bit confusing to me because I have never watch this cartoon before

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

The clip of the cartoon is really adorable, and the clarity of the voice is high.
You can have more variations on different characters, and add some BGM to some of the plot.

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

The transcript is clear, it shows lines for each character, also, the topic is interesting, you even copy the laughing between the lines. BTW, your video clip is really adorable XD.
Do you try to copy the tone of Steven? Cause I think if you imitate his voice it would be really cool XD

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
Why do you want to redub this story?

Love the cartoon! Your pronunciation is good. Which cartoon is your favorite from CN?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

I can feel the different tones in the video and also the voice is clear. The transcript is presented in a reader-friendly way. I think only in some part the voice is a little low, but maybe is because you want to match the plots.

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

I like the video choice but actually there are two people choosing the same cartoon.
Good tone adding in your voice according to different characters. 

The voice is not clear and low, and sometimes the background music is even louder than your voice.
maybe add some voice changing according to the different characters to distinguish them.
Add subtitle is suggested.
pronunciation can be improved

Is this your favorite cartoon?

1.The voice is loud.
2. She speaks emotionally.
3. The sound effects are great!

Overall, it's terrific! However, it think the voice could be more clear.

positives
1 the tone is well controlled and fits the character
2 the video chosen is quite interesting 
3 if there are some subtitles will be better

things I wondered
Do you think Sardonyx is cool or disgusting?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

The cartoon clips are cute, rich and creative, easy to understand, and can easy to understand what she's saying without reading the script. However, the voice quality will be a little poor, and then the voice of the characters is not distinguishable, I will think that the same character is speaking the lines.

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

funny cartoon XD. No big issues at all. Only ''disaster'' the s sound should be pronounce z sound. But that's not a big deal.

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

First of all I have to say the transcripts you provided is so clear and so well-organized! It is so easy and comfortable to read, and I love it. And I want to mention how you "zoom-out" the voice of Peridot is really amusing. I like the effort you put into the details. It could be better if you make different voice for the characters since there are many characters in the clip. Do you often watch this anime? It is so fun!

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the video is fun
the volume is good 
Sound effect is good

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

I think you speak well and the video is interesting. But I think your voice sometimes is a little low and I can't hear it clearly. I am wondering what happens next!

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

The animation is surely good. The editing of BGM and the dub is also good. I wonder how you can distinguish the voice pitch for different characters.

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

I love your redubbing. The voice is clear and sync with the original clip well. The sound effects are amazing as well. However, some words aren't well-pronounced enough like the "ed" in past tense. But overall, I love this video and this episode as well. My favorite parts of this episode are this part and Amethyst's singing. What's your favorite part?

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and fluent, and there are some sound effects, which is great. However, it would be wonderful if you add subtitles, too.
Are you a fan of this cartoon?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The video is really interesting! And the way you express emotions in the video is really captivating! It really adds dynamic to the video. I also really like the background music. I also like how you incorporated graph in the transcript - it clearly presents the dialogues.  However there are several characters in your video, if you can differentiate the voice between each, I think the content will be even more understandable for the viewers. In terms of pronunciation, I think you can make greater distinctions and perhaps exaggerate them? One thing I am wondering: what is the name of this cartoon? It seems interesting:)

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

1. the format of transcript is readable and clear
2.you manipulate your tone well
3.this video is quite interesting and you can raise your pitch to demonstrate the character's emotion more.
Is the film they watched touched? I think it is quite freaky,lol~
