1. A very well-edit video clip
2. I can hear your voice very clearly
3. It would be great if you add subtitles to the clip!

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The time code in the transcript helps a lot. 2. Your voice is clear and energetic. 3. In the latter part of the video, you were starting to stutter a little. Perhaps slowing down will help.
Q: Does this video help you find ways to release your stress?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

The video clip is closely related to life and the voice in the video is clear enough. Because this video has lots of difficult words, it would be better if you put subtitles.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
How do you release stress?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

Your voice is really clear and vivid, and the background music is really proper for the plots!
You can add more circumflex into different sentences.
I am wondering that whether you have the same problem with the character?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

I can tell that this one is a quiet difficult clip for dubbing, cause it contains many proper nouns in the video, but you did great. I think you can add some Chinese for those proper nouns, it can help us to know your clips well.
I am curious about why do you choose this video clip for dubbing? Cause it is really hard :(

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

Smooth work, well done, clear voice in general.
good tone

The voice changing is a little weird when you say" your very stressful symbolize"( not sure am I wrong), it really turns from clear to  unclear.
can add some background music changing and louder.

Do you usually feel stressed?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Very informative video, and your tone sound like a professional narrator. But I think you can fix some minor pronunciation mistakes. Do you have similar experience before?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

good voice, and the topic shows a deep relationship with students. When introducing exercising, the speed is a little bit too fast. By the way, do you think these ways are useful or not?

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

1.The voice is clear and loud enough.
2. The content is amusing.
I think the tone of speech is relatively plain, it could have more tonation in order to attract viewers!

I think our brain is very interesting, sometimes words have came up to our lips but we just can't say it or remember the exact words.

positives
1 the theme is quite thoughtful
2 the background music is nice while the voice is clear 
3 if there are any subtitles will be better

things I wondered
Did the video change your thoughts about the stress?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

The volume is good, then the footage is informative, and then sometimes her tone is natural. And then there's too much snorting in the voice, which can distract the audience. Then it's a little hard to understand what's being said without subtitles.

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

The pronunciation and the voice quality is excellent. The redubbing sync with the video clip very well. However, the filenames don't quite well-structured. And if you can strengthen some key words, it would be better. Question: the words in this video are quite hard. Why did you choose this video? How long did it take for you to redub and edit?

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

your voice is quite clear and makes it easy to know the content. i suggest that you can add cc in your video. I am curious why you choose the video?

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

the intonation is good
the video is infoemative
I sometimes hear mic noise, try to improve that issue.

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

First of all I want to say I like the way you speak. Your pronunciation, speed, pauses are proper so I had no difficulty following you. Plus, the music displayed in the clip is calm and it fits the topic! So I enjoy it and I felt relaxed. It would be better if the volume of each voice is balanced. And the microphone sometimes captured breath sounds, so this could be improved. But overall, this is a video that I would be willing to watch. It is just so relaxing! Did you try to relax too when you made it? Your voice fit it so well!

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

Your speaking speed and clarity are spectacular, and the topic is reasonable too. I wonder how you edit the video, because I hear some clear intermittent.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud, and ghe voice also sync with the video.  However, it would be more understandable if you add subtitles. 
Do you  have a good memory?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

It is extremely nice of you to provide the time on your transcript! Also the topic is really educational - I learned a lot about the relationship between stress and memory. I also think the speech flow is really fluent! In terms of pronunciation, I think you can work more on the vowels, for some vowels I think the articulation can be done "more fully" (I think you can exaggerate the pronunciation?)? One thing I am wondering: will you apply these theories and techniques when you come across a lot of stress for an important event next time?
