1. It is amazing how you record the lines of different characters with different tones
2. The video is well-edit with subtitles 
3. Is this a clip from a cartoon?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. You imitating the characters' tone is really fun to hear! 2. Your voice is really clear. 3. Sometimes your voice isn't syncing with the video. Maybe edit the recording to make them match?
Q: Have you watched the entire series of this animation?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

I really like your different tones in the clip and also have other soundtracks which gave me many surprises.

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is very clear.
Your clip is well designed.
You did very well on this task.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

I like the way you mimic the characters' speaking way, and the plots are adorable.
Some pronunciations can be improved with more practices!
I am wondering whether all the effects are added by yoruself?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Good video choice, interesting and creative.
video quality is good and background music is fine

Your recording quality is not very good that there is a lot of 
You can try to change your voice (not only the tone) to distinguish the characters
pronunciation can be improved( for instance: exchange student, ridiculous, completely)

What happen to the guy who was taken away by the monster ? Is anyone going to catch the monster back?

Love this cartoon a lot, great choice! Very good voice acting. But, some of the characters’ voice sounded too similar. What’s your favorite cartoon show?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

I know this cartoon lol. Star vs. the Forces of Evil , right? I really like your dubbing, it's so cute and I can see that you put lots of emotion into it. 
I wonder do still watch this cartoon now? Or only in childhood?

great voice, and the story is funny. Also the intonation is excellent.

<===== REVIEWER No. 10 =====>

1.The dubbing is full of emotions!
2. I love the cartons! It's colorful!

Overall, I loves it! The emotions, tonation and the volume is also good.

I am wondering what's name of the carton.

positives
1 the video is cute and attracting
2 the sound effect is really nice!
3 not pretty sure the word "dimension" is pronounced correctly 

things I wondered
Do you think Star can take the responsibility?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

I love your redub. It sounds every energetic, just like the original. The voice and the pronunciation are very good as well. However, some voice don't sync the original video. Maybe you could try redubbing more times. Finally, I wonder that in this cartoon, who is your favorite character?(mine is Star:D)

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the tone is so dynamic
the voice is clear
the effect sound is great

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Oh my God! It's really cute! The film and sound quality are great, apart from a little pop at times, I think they are very good. After watching it, I wonder if Star Butterfly will destroy the earth.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

Your voice acting is dramatic! I like it when you layered the voice when there are more than one person speaking. It shows your effort in making this video. It would be even better if you distinguish their voices more obviously. But this version is still very attractive and fun! And I was thinking it would be interesting if you dubbed for the monster, too!(not sure if the original version dubbed for the monster or not)

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

Star Butterfly is a great show that I watched before. You interpret it just fine. I still wonder why you use the same volume all the time.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

The sound effects are great and the redubbing voice is clear and loud. You talk vividly and you even try to use different voices when different character talks.
Are you a huge fan of this cartoon?

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The video is extremely interesting! I really enjoyed it:) and your acting is so great haha! However there are several characters in your video and they are all presented through your voice - perhaps you can make some distinction between the different characters? Overall it's very good! One thing I am wondering: why do Star's parents think that Star will "improve on behaviors" by sending her to Earth?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

your video is sooo adorable and so is your sound. one minor issue is that your voice may be covered by the sound effects, which let the sound to be not clear enough. But overall I LIKE IT~
Do you want to dress up like the princess in the video one day?
