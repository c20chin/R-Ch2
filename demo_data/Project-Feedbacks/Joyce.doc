1. A well-edit video and clear voice
2.  It would be great to add subtitles to the video!
3. So do most of the cats today still have a predator instincts their ancestors once had?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. Standard American accent. 2. The bgm fits the atmosphere of the video. 
Q: Do you have a cat at home?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
There is a sound at the end that I think it will be better if it is edited. 
Do cats know we are their owners?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

1. it will be better if the voice be louder 2.the music is super lovely 3. at the end of the movie, you as if rise the intonation immediately, so it may not be decent for the intonation~

how can you add the special effect that excellent!?

<===== REVIEWER No. 5 =====>

The theme of the video is really therapeutic, and your voice is clear.
You can add more circumflex when saying different sentences.

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

Clear voice
smooth lines
If listen carefully, there is a noise(). Not sure is it due to your recording quality or what.
If you could add subtitles, it would help a lot for the viewer.
Adding more tone is a suggestion.

So do you like cats?

Cute video! And good narrating tone! But you can fix some of the pronunciation. Overall, it’s good! Do you like cats or dogs more?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

topic is very interesting, and the voice is clear. subtitles can be added. Do the cats eat geckos?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

Interesting topic. I always have a question that why cat can be so evil and cute at the same time, thanks for answer my question lol. Also your voice is clear, good job！

1.The pronunciation is good.
2.The video is interesting.
It could be better if the background music could be adjusted a bit lower.

Do humans want to have dogs as their pets more or cats?

positives
1 the theme is cute and eye-catching
2 the background music is nice and soothing
3  It would be nice to add the subtitles

things I wondered
Do you have your own cat? How was it like?

First, the video is well-edited. It has other sound effect added that makes the video more entertaining and the voice sync with the video clip. Second, I love your video choice. The length and topic are both good. On the other hand, the volume is a little small and if you can add some rhythm to your redubbing and strengthen some KEY words, it would be better. Last, we want to ask how you edit the sound effect and background music? Is it the same  from the original video or you added it on your own?

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the volume of her voice should be a little bit louder.
the speed is suitable.
the music is smoothy.

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

This video is cute and attractive, and your voice is clear to understand. Maybe you can try to add cc in your video! I am curious about what do you think the way cats look us.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

There is a good background music in the video, and also cute sound effects of cats. However, it would be even better if you add subtitles. 
You must be a cats lover, right? Do you have a pet cat?

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

The sound is clear and the film is smooth. Then I like Joyce's tone very much, which is suitable for the atmosphere of the video clip. As a cat lover, I personally think this content is really great, it makes me know more about cats, love. After watching it, I was curious where Joyce found this movie. I also wanted to see it!

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

I like the vibe of your video. It is very relaxing and delightful to watch. Also it is informative, which makes it even better. Though you didn't include subtitles, I can understand you perfectly for your pronunciation and speed are very easy to follow. The ending is dramatic, too. I love that. There might be one thing that can be improved, that is the volume of music. Sometime the music was loud enough to cover your voice, but other than that there are no big issue! After I finishing watching the video, I just want to ask you : do you have a cat? This video makes me imagine you are a cat person :D

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

That explains the reason why cats are so annoying in some people's perspective. The animation is also great. I still wander why you chose this 4mins and half video though.

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The video quality is really good! The dubbing is presented clearly and the background music is really soothing. The topic is also really interesting; it truly helped me to get into depth the behaviors of cats. I also think you put extra work in the intonation, but I think the speech can be more fluent (i.e., sometimes you work very hard on pronouncing every single word but ends up neglecting the overall flow of each sentence)? One thing I am wondering: Do different cat have different opinions of how they perceive their owners? (some see their owners as predators, some preys?)
