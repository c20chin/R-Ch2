1. A well-edit clip with a clear and great pace
2. It is cool to use a real personâ€™s presentation as a video-dubbing clip
3. So is the speaker an inventor of many things?

<===== REVIEWER No. 2 =====>

1. The accent is amazing. 2. The talking is fluent.
Q: Is this really the edited file or is it you are too good that I can't tell the difference?

<===== REVIEWER No. 3 =====>

Your voice is clear.
Your clip is well designed.
It will be better if you can include subtitles in your video clip.
Why do you want to redub this story?

<===== REVIEWER No. 4 =====>

Your voice is nearly matched with the original voice, and the theme is pretty interesting.
Maybe you can add some BGM.
I am wondering whether you would want to be a speaker on TED one day in the future?

The voice changing is really good that it  sounds like the presenter's real voice.
Smooth work and funny video

The lines sometimes wasn't fit to the speaker's mouthing.
The voice quality is not clear and have a robotic sounds(?)
The video ends quite abruptly.
Would you like to use the tooth brush helmet?

<===== REVIEWER No. 6 =====>

The voice and the pronunciation both are really clear. And the content of the video is really interesting. But because the speed of this speech isn't slow, it would be better if you put subtitles.

<===== REVIEWER No. 7 =====>

1.vowel sounds are great 2.you may add some stress to emphasize some key words 
the fear to stand on stage always makes concerns to most of us.  I like the solution that speaker provide, do you have another one that works as well?

<===== REVIEWER No. 8 =====>

Good job on fitting the mouth shape, and itâ€™s a cool speech! Good voice acting. There are some parts that the audienceâ€™s voice got cut, it felt a bit weird. Do you want to buy any of the things she invented?

<===== REVIEWER No. 9 =====>

1.The sound is loud.
2.I think it's awesome since I feel it's not easy to dub a live talk.

The voice can be more clear.

positives
1 the voice is really nice and fluent!
2 the sound effect were added properly

feedback
It would be better to add some background music to make the video more appealing.

things I wondered
Will you try to solve problems creatively in your life like the orator?

<===== REVIEWER No. 11 =====>

I think your dubbing is really great. I can't even distinguish your voice and the original voice.  ( And Somehow your sound really match the speaker's face ðŸ¤£ )No big issue with your dubbing, just sometimes your voice would be slightly slower than the speaker's lip.
Do you agree with what the speaker said? We should do useless things ?

<===== REVIEWER No. 12 =====>

the first one take lecturing as topic. The sound is so similar to the woman's real sound. I suggest that you can add subtitles since it is not a training our listening.

<===== REVIEWER No. 13 =====>

the tone is great 
the video is funny

<===== REVIEWER No. 14 =====>

Your video is interesting haha! It breaks my impression to TED. I think you can add cc. I am wondering what supports her to do these things.

<===== REVIEWER No. 15 =====>

Your pronunciation and fluency is EXCELLENT! I first thought it was from the original video! And your voice sync with the original clip very well. As for the sound effects, maybe you can find some laughter track rather than use the original. It will make it sound more natural. After watching the video, I REALLY want to know what the speaker wanted to say after showing us so many inventions. It looks like an interesting topic.

<===== REVIEWER No. 16 =====>

I feel very impressive, because the voice and the video clip mouth shape are right, and then the voice is also right on the film inside the people's emotions and body, very impressive! Then when I saw it, I really felt funny. This video clip was really funny. I wonder if she ever made a machine about changing clothes, you don't have to match your own clothes, the machine will match your clothes for you. Don't worry about me. It's just my imagination.

<===== REVIEWER No. 17 =====>

I guess it really changes our perspective in useful and useless. The video makes our creativity better. I wonder how I can deal with my "useless" warobes now.

<===== REVIEWER No. 18 =====>

The redubbing voice is clear and loud, and there are some sound effects that make the video more interesting. However, it would be more understandable if you add subtitles. 
Do you make useless things, too?

<===== REVIEWER No. 19 =====>

The topic of the video is really interesting! Your intonation also makes the content more intriguing. However I think you can work on the vowels, make more distinctions and exaggerate them. One thing I am wondering: Which machine exhibited in the video exhibited in the video do you think is the most interesting?
